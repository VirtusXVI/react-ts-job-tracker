Project Name: Job Tracker
Tach: React + TS, Tailwind, Firebase Auth, Firebase DB

TODO:
    1. Create a modal for the Login and the Job Application Detail
    2. Fill the body with cards containing basic informations about the Job Application
    3. Create a DB using Firebase DB and connect it to the application(Tables: User, Job Application)

Problems:
    1. I want to use a single modal component and adapt it for every situation(login, filters, etc.) -> I pass a string to the component that modifies the structure of the modal(NOTE:I should use a context for all modals)
